## Structure:
## start indicates the beginning of the dataset. It will include input city as well as expected output
## first line after start is the city name
## Next line is first book title, followed by a line containing its authors (commaseparated if multiple)
## This pattern continues until the end tag which indicates the end of that piece of test data.

## NOTE: none of this is necissarily sorted, this must be done in test program.
